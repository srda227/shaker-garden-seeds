The Research Process of Tracking the Shaker Seed Trade through Newspaper Advertisements

Summary of Project

The composition of this dataset required an initial collection from the online source, Chronicling
America. Following this compilation, the data was divided and cleaned through the use of a
spreadsheet program. The data was then mapped using geocoding software, and verificatied by
the project facilitators.

Research Methods

Chronicling America is an online database that features more than a million digitized
newspapers. Even with the established topic, the magnanimous number of newspapers reflected
in the search results of our initial inquiry. When entering the phrase “Shaker Seeds,” the site
launched approximately 2,800 results. It was deduced that this number of results could not be
properly filtered and verified efficiently, given time constraints. Therefore, the search inquiry
was changed to “Shaker Garden Seeds,” thus refining the results further. The phrase was entered
into the site's ‘advanced search,’ which rendered 1,888 results. To quickly obtain and apply the
results to the spreadsheet, the team manipulated the site's link to produce the results on a single
page. The metadata from the rendered list was captured and inserted into a separate Excel
spreadsheet.

Verifying the Dataset

After the data was gathered and consolidated, it was processed and classified under labels. To
delineate the data into particular sections, delimiters were used within the software’s ‘Text to
Column’ feature. Since the data gathered appeared to be listed as results with no discernable
categories, delimiters and keys such as ‘,’ and ‘,’, were applied, separating the data into 15
categories, the most notable being the periodical’s title, longitude, and latitude, and the date of its
publication as well as when a shaker add appeared (delineated into month, day, and year). The
verification process took place once the dataset had been refined and filtered. Each team member
was assigned a range of approximately 200 entries to verify. After the dataset was verified, it was
ready to be applied to geocoding software.

Significance of the Project

Documenting the Shaker Seed trade provides a new way of understanding how the United
Society of Believers conducted their daily lives, managed their micro-economy, supported their
communities, and conducted communication with neighboring peoples and secular communities.
The work to track and verify advertisements of Shaker Seeds has laid the foundation for other
scholars to build upon our research and document all of these avenues. This dataset is accessible
on GitHub, which is available for public use. This dataset is a point of reference to spur future
research regarding the Shaker Seed trade. This research was possible by the Shaker Village
Pleasant Hill, Becky Soules, and Dr. Stephen Davis. This project would not have been completed
without their help.
